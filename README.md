# OOP - Principles
Project introduces the rules of OOP. Done for the PROE course.

This console UI app has been created to become familiar with fundamental rules of **Object Oriented Programming**. In my program I focused on following things:
* Inheritance
* Abstract class
* Virtual methods
* Operators overloading
* Class type-casting
* SDL library

To run application use ```RunApp.bat```
